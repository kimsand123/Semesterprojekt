# Before you start:
- Guide below if you do not have the flutter pack on your computer:

# Build to iOS for TestFlight

    - 'flutter clean'
    - 'flutter build ios'

    - Change the target to 'Generic iOS Device' in the top menu.
    - Open Window -> Organizer
    - When the build is done select the new build
    - Click 'Distribute App'
    - Select 'App Store Connect' and click next
    - Select 'Upload' and click next
    - Select distribution options (we have had both turned on) and click next
    - Select 'Automatically manage signing' and click next
    - Click Upload.
